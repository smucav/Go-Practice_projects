# Go Practice Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the **Go Practice Projects** repository! This repository is designed to help developers learn and practice Golang by building real-world projects. Each project within this repository focuses on a specific concept in Go, ranging from concurrency and networking to system design and data structures. The goal is to bridge theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, making learning more effective and engaging.

## Why This Repository?
Many beginners struggle with learning Go because they lack practical exposure. This repository serves as a structured collection of projects, each targeting a core Go concept, allowing learners to:
- **Understand concepts deeply** through practical implementation.
- **See how different concepts connect** by working on related projects.
- **Gain real-world experience** by working on scalable and efficient Go programs.
- **Collaborate with other developers**, share insights, and contribute to open-source projects.

## How It Works
Each project in this repository is built to highlight a specific Go feature or best practice while also demonstrating how different concepts connect. You can explore projects based on the topics you want to master, as well as how they relate to other concepts in Go. Some of the areas covered include:
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines, channels, worker pools, and task queues.
- **Networking**: TCP/UDP servers, WebSockets, and RESTful APIs.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implementing stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables in Go.
- **Interconnected Concepts**: Projects that demonstrate how different Go features work together in real-world applications.

## Projects Included
- **Shared Task Queue Service** - Demonstrates task management using a concurrent queue.
- **Message Broadcast Service** - Implements a real-time messaging system using TCP connections.
- **Website Hit Counter** - Tracks and stores website visits efficiently.
- **Auction Monitor** - A client-server system where users can bid on an auction in real time.
- **And More!**
